# maximize-tearoff

Web extension that automatically maximizes new windows created by tearing off tabs.

## Description

If you're annoyed that you're always manually maximizing newly torn-off windows, this addon is for you.

On some operating systems, when tearing off tabs from a maximized browser window, the newly created window is not also maximized.

Installing this addon ensures that new windows created in such a manner will match the origin window's maximized state.
